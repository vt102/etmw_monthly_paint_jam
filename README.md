## Guidelines

Try to keep suggestions as wide open as possible. "Squad leader" would
be better than "Space Marine Captain," but "heroic leader" or
"commander" unit would be better than "squad letter," letting member
choose to paint aerial squadron commanders, naval flaships, etc...

The goal is that members have a lot of lattitude so that they can
continue to make progress in their own personal projects while still
participating in the paint jam!
